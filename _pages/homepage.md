## Coming Soon - DjangoCon US is coming to the Pacific Northwest!

Save the date: **August 13 - 18, 2017** and set your out-of-office reply because you’ll be in Spokane, Washington, for DjangoCon US!

Most out-of-towners will say “spo-cane” a few times before they realize everyone else is saying “spo-can,” as in, Spokane you come to DjangoCon? (Get it?)

Join us for tutorials, talks, sprints, and the events you’ve come to love at DjangoCon US.

You’ll love visiting Spokane! If you’re outdoorsy, Spokane has lots of nature, rafting, waterfalls, affordable and plentiful golf, and moose sightings. The city of Spokane also has a beautiful historic downtown, a fantastic art community, breweries and wineries, and lots of elevated, covered skywalks.

## Call for Proposals (CFP)

Our [CFP for talks and tutorials](https://www.papercall.io/djangocon-us-2017) is now open! The deadline for submissions is April 10, 2017. We’re looking for speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds. Talk and tutorial presenters also receive free admission to DjangoCon US.
