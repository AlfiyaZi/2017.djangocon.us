  Do you want to share a room at the venue with other attendees, or have accommodation available?
---

Do you want to share a room at the [venue](/venue/#welcome) (Hotel RL by Red Lion Spokane at the Park) with other attendees, or have accommodation available? List yourself below, along with:

- how many other people you want to share with,
- what nights you'll be there,
- whether you've already reserved a room, and
- any other requirements (e.g. male/female, smoking/non).

**Note:** _If any of your roommates will be arriving separately, be sure to list their names on the reservation as having permission to check in and get a key to your shared room from the front desk by showing photo ID._

_When reserving your room, be sure to specify the type and number of beds! Some rooms only have a single king size bed; not ideal for platonic room sharing._

**Caution:** Room sharing arrangements are the responsibilities of the individual parties involved. DEFNA, DSF, and DjangoCon US Staff takes no responsibility, and cannot be involved in any disputes.
