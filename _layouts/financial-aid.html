If you will not be able to attend DjangoCon US without financial help, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>Do I need to be a speaker, first time attendee, or a member of an underrepresented group to receive aid?</li>

                <P>We try to allocate financial aid to a diverse set of attendees based on need. Our review process is holistic and takes into account many different factors, most importantly being the impact we think attending DjangoCon US will have on the applicant. We want to encourage everyone who needs aid to apply for it. Do not rule yourself out before you have even applied!</P>

              <li>When will I receive my aid?</li>
                <p>Financial aid is paid to the recipient at the conference or shortly after.</p>

              <li>How will I receive my aid?</li>
                <p>Financial aid is paid to the recipient in the form of a check for US account holders. A bank transfer is used for non US account holders. We typically use TransferWise for international payments, but have used other services for currencies they do not support.</p>

                <p>We require receipts for the items that the financial aid was spent on.</p>

              <li>Is there anything I should know if I am an travelling into the U.S. from another country?</li>
                <p>If you are travelling into the United States, we strongly encourage you to to wait to purchase airfare or book a hotel room until after your visa has been accepted.</p>

                <p>You can request a visa letter by <a href="mailto:hello@djangocon.us">emailing us.</a>

                <p>If you are denied entry to the US with a valid visa, we will pay your non-refundable costs (up to the amount of your financial aid).</p>

              <li>What if there is an emergency and I am not able to attend?</li>
                <p>If you are denied entry to the US with a valid visa, we will pay your non-refundable costs (up to the amount of your financial aid). For other emergencies or additional costs, we will review the recipient’s need on a case by case basis.</p>
