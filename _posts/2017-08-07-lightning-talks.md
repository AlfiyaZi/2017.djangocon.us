A Lightning Talk (or, as we like to call them, "⚡️Talk") is a short (5 minute **maximum**) talk on just about any relevant topic. They range from serious and informative to whimsical and musical (*the image above is from an actual ⚡️Talk*) to quick demonstrations. 

If you've ever thought about giving a talk at a conference, but you're nervous or don't think you "know enough" to give a full-length talk, consider a ⚡️Talk. They can be an excellent way to get started as a conference presenter. Remember: there are many ways to contribute to the Django, Python and Open Source communities. One way is giving talks. *This* could be how you start!

If you proposed a talk for DjangoCon US 2017 and it wasn't accepted, consider condensing some of the key points into a ⚡️Talk.

⚡️Talks will be [Monday-Wednesday at 12:50pm](https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/) in Ballrooms B & C. Sign-ups will happen at the conference. We look forward to seeing your talks.
