Andrew will be presenting his talk “Architecting with Channels”:

Django Channels came in with one headline feature - WebSockets - but the impact on Django and the projects you can now write using it is far greater.

Andrew will explain the overall architecture of Channels, and how it fundamentally changes Django in ways that allow for new kinds of code to be written while keeping familiar APIs and being entirely backwards compatible, before going on to showcase some advanced feature examples, scaling methods and concerns, and deployment strategies.

Among other things, you’ll discover how to use Channels to data-bind WebSockets against Django models, see how consumers can work with incoming emails rather than just web protocols, and how to integrate your own asynchronous code for low-level networking with a Channels-based project.
