Janice will be presenting her talk “Breaking Through the Glass Walls of Tech”:

54% of women leave tech by year 10 in their career. Our industry is losing great talent, diverse perspectives, and opportunities daily. We aren’t moving the needle as fast as we need to, and organizations and industry leaders alike are trying to figure out why. In her talk, Janice will tell you the history of and inspiration behind ChickTech, the top three issues that are holding back progress towards gender equity in tech, and how we can start breaking through those barriers.
