## Coming Soon - DjangoCon US is coming to the Pacific Northwest! 

Save the date: August 13 - 18, 2017 and set your out-of-office reply because you’ll be in Spokane, Washington, for DjangoCon US! 

Most out-of-towners will say “spo-cane” a few times before they realize everyone else is saying “spo-can,” as in, Spokane you come to DjangoCon? (Get it?) 

Join us for tutorials, talks, sprints, and the events you’ve come to love at DjangoCon US. 

You’ll love visiting Spokane! If you’re outdoorsy, Spokane has lots of nature, rafting, waterfalls, affordable and plentiful golf, and moose sightings. The city of Spokane also has a beautiful historic downtown, a fantastic art community, breweries and wineries, and lots of elevated, covered skywalks. 

Can’t wait for the CFP? Start working on your proposal now! Our CFP will be up in Spring 2017, but that’s no reason not to get to work on the first draft of your first (or third, or thirteenth) DjangoCon talk. 

Sponsors! We can’t put on DjangoCon without you. Go ahead and drop us a line so we can talk to you about how we can make it easy for you to sponsor us.
